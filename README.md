GreenMail

Mods by Pfiver
--------------
This version brings seemless interoperability to [Apache James Hupa](http://james.apache.org/hupa/index.html) by
automatically writing a config file and setting a system property that HUPA will pick up. The released version
of Hupa is really old. Better use the 0.0.5-SNAPSHOT build that can be downloaded [from the integration server](
https://builds.apache.org/job/hupa-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.apache.james.hupa$hupa/).

Contribution guidelines
-----------------------

### Code formatter ###
Please set your code formatter to use 4 spaces for indentation of Java files (not tabs) and
to two spaces for xml files (like the pom.xml)

### Bill of Materials ###
We have the pom.xml in the root where we set the versions of all dependencies to keep them consistent
among subprojects. Please do not add any version tags into the child pom.xml files.

### Starting your pull request ###
The best strategy for opening a pull request is to add the this repository ( https://github.com/greenmail-mail-test/greenmail )
as the "upstream" to your .git/config such as:

    [remote "upstream"]
    url = https://github.com/greenmail-mail-test/greenmail.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/upstream/*

Then you fetch "upstream" and create a new branch at upstream/master (name it issue-XXX or something like that).
Now you can add commits on that branch and then create a pull request for that branch (after pushing it to your
github). That way commits are isolated for one feature.

### Tests for your pull request ###
Please also create a test for every feature you add. We know that currently there aren't many tests but in
the medium term we want to increase test coverage.
